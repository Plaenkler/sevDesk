Plaenkler/sevDesk enables HTTP requests to be made to the [sevDesk API](https://api.sevdesk.de/). The library abstracts the constructs and allows developers to interact with the sevDesk API through a convenient and intuitive interface.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project goals

- [ ] Client with automatic token renewal

## âœ… Examples

A separate example has been implemented for each interface of the API. All examples use the client for authentication except the authentication example itself if there is a desire to implement a separate client.
